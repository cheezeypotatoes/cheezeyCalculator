# Basic Calculator
## Uses only vanilla js, html and css

Hello, thank you for looking at my project. This is a basic calculator that was an assignment for a 12 week coding boot camp. I was never able to finish it because those boot camps just rush you on to another technology after spending only a few days on another thing. I didn't make it through that boot camp but I started the free course at [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com). It just so happens that the final project of the web development 101 course is to build an on screen calculator. So I had a good start on an on screen calc drawn up already in html and css but little js to go with it. It is now much more functional though still not without issues. Currently it can only accurately handle a 2 number equation. I need to build in functionality to update the result on an operator click so it can handle more that 2 numbers. If you would like to use this for an assignment I ask that you just change the variable names so you then at least have to go through the code and change them wherever they are referenced. Like I said this is not perfect and I will be adding a list of bugs to fix. Feel free to add a bug or submit a pull request. Happy coding and hang in there!!
